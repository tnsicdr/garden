      Welcome to my unorganized corner of the internet, where I ideate, record,
      and learn in the open. Learn more about <a
        href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history"

      If you're looking for more organized content written with intent, you may
      be looking for my <a href="https://code.tnsi.me/">blog</a>. Otherwise,
      pardon the dust and chaos and take a look at my <a href="./notes">notes</a
      >. Currently this is under construction and doesn't have any actual
      content.
